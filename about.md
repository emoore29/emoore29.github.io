Hi, I'm Emma! Currently, I'm a student at the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/) completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology. In the past, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing, and I've worked primarily in court transcription for the last five years.

<br>

I decided to pursue a career in IT when, after reflecting on my career trajectory, I realised that the kind of work I find most fulfilling is work that requires careful thought and creative solutions.

<br>

Growing up, some of my favourite games were [Myst and Riven](https://cyan.com/games/), where I learned to exercise the persistence and patience required to solve their challenging puzzles. During my undergraduate degree, I found myself most engaged in the units that developed my analytical and critical thinking skills.

<br>

I'm excited to build a career that combines these skills with the attention-to-detail and organisational capabilities I've developed through my studies and professional experience.

<br>

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our cat, reading, and watching the latest episode of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).
