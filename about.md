Hi, I'm Emma! Currently, I'm a student at the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/) completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology. In the past, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing, and I've worked primarily in court transcription for the last five years.

<br>

After reflecting on my career, I decided I wanted a new challenge and to work in a field that was a better match for my personal interests and strengths, which led me to where I am now. You can read more about why I chose IT [here]({{site.url}}/notes/2025/02/10/my-career-change.html).

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our cat, reading, and watching the latest episode of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).
