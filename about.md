Hi, I'm Emma! Currently, I'm a student at the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/) completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology. In the past, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing, and I've worked in the editing field for the last five years.

<br>

What I enjoy about professional writing transfers to how I approach coding: I'm driven to create accessible user experiences built with well-organised and documented code.

<br>

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our cat, reading, and watching the latest episode of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).
