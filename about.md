Hi! I'm Emma. I'm a student at the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/), completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology.

#### My Background

Previously, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing at [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au/). I've worked in the editing field for the last five years.

In 2022, I started teaching myself to code to try something new and challenging. I started with some free courses on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and quickly realised this was something I wanted to pursue more seriously, leading me to where I am today.
