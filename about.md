Hi! I'm Emma. I'm a student at the University of New England, completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology.

#### my background

Previously, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing at Curtin University. I've worked in the editing field for the last five years.

In 2022, I decided to learn how to code. I wasn't feeling inspired by my editing career and wanted a new challenge. I loved maths in high school and wanted to experience the satisfying feeling of solving challenging problems again.

I started with some free courses on freeCodeCamp and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I started building various websites with React-based frameworks and self-studying things like logic gates and computer networking.

I wanted to expand my experience and improve my foundational understanding of computer science, so I decided to pursue a more formal education, which brings me to where I am now. I'm estimated to complete my Graduate Diploma by late 2025.
