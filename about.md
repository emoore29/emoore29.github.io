Hi, I'm Emma! Currently, I'm a student at the [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/) completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology. In the past, I completed a BA in Professional Writing and Publishing, and I've worked primarily in court transcription for the last several years. I got into IT because I enjoy solving problems, building useful tools, and constantly learning.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our cat, reading, and watching the latest episode of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).
