<h4 id="logic-gates">Logic Gates</h4>

<p>Logic gates are small electrical circuits wired in such a way as to process binary inputs into a binary output. To do this, they use transistors, which are basically electronic switches that can be turned on or off.</p>

<p>I’ll only show a couple of the electrical circuits, since it’s not necessary to understand the electronics to understand how the gates are used to build a computer. I think the AND gate is one of the easiest to understand.</p>

<p>A NAND gate is so named because it is a negative AND gate. So the C output will be the opposite of an AND gate. Inputs A and B must both be on for the output, C, to be off.</p>

<p>You can start to see how logic gates can be combined in various ways to start building out a computer. However, these gates can also be made directly with transistors, which is much more efficient for building modern computers. Here’s a transistor OR gate, which is a bit simpler than combining two NOT gates and a NAND gate:</p>

They didn’t want to be locked into paying subscription fees for CMSs such as Wordpress or Wix, and had a custom design in mind. They also wanted to be able to update the website themselves and not have to go through me every time they wanted to add or remove a photo of their work.</p>

<p>I decided to use Sanity as the backend platform on which my client could update the website content, and Next.js as the framework I used to build the frontend, since I was already familiar with it. Sanity handles the authentication.</p>

<p>These are the primary guides I used to get started with the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-site-with-sanity-and-nextjs/#heading-what-is-sanity">How to Build a Portfolio Site with Sanity and Next.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sanity.io/guides/sanity-webhooks-and-on-demand-revalidation-in-nextjs">Sanity Webhooks and On-demand Revalidation in Nextjs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve created this flowchart to provide an overview of how the website works:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/dpa/dpa-flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart overview of website architecture." /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="configuring-sanity">Configuring Sanity</h4>

<p>I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next-sanity</code> toolkit to mount Sanity Studio to the Next.js application, such that it would be hosted with the Next.js app. I configured the base path as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/studio</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanity.config.ts</code>, and using Next.js’s App routing, implemented <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments">optional catch-all dynamic routes</a> for accessing the various studio pages at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/(studio)/studio/[[...index]]/page.tsx</code>. This means that the studio will be accessible at https://www.donnapriceart.com/studio/(+ any additional url segments). Those additional segments are created as follows.</p>

<p>The structure of each section that my client can update are defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/schemas</code> directory:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about.ts</code> - defines the structure of the about page, including a page title, slug, image, and description field</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">art.ts</code> - defines the structure of an art document, including a title, slug, main image, category, and description</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">category.ts</code> - defines the categories of art, with a title, slug, description, and order field</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockContent.ts</code> - defines rich text fields that can be used in other fields, for example, descriptions</li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code></strong> - schemaTypes is defined for import into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanity.config.ts</code> (including all of the above schemas), which makes them available to the studio route.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deskStructure.js</code> file in which art is grouped based on its category so that my client can easily view their art in the studio based on category: this is added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanity.config.ts</code> via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desk-tool</code> plugin.</p>

<p>Therefore, the following url segments are accessible at https://www.donnapriceart.com/studio/structure, where my client can manage their website content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>/art</li>
  <li>/about</li>
  <li>/category</li>
  <li>/watercolorMixedMedia</li>
  <li>/oilPaintings</li>
  <li>/illustrations</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="groq-graph-relational-object-queries">GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries)</h4>

<p>The queries used to retrieve documents from Sanity are defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanity/sanity.query.ts</code> file. For example, for a given category, the getArtFromCategory query will request art from a category passed in as a parameter via a sanityFetch() function.</p>

<p>The art can then be passed to a Gallery component, which handles displaying the art, along with the title and description.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sanityFetch()</code> function also takes a tag. This tag is useful for data revalidation.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="on-demand-data-revalidation">On-demand data revalidation</h4>

<p>I wanted my client to see their website update any time they made a change in Sanity Studio, so I used on-demand data revalidation to achieve this.</p>

<p>On-demand revalidation is the process of purging the data cache and re-fetching the latest content based on an event, as opposed to time-based revalidation, that automatically revalidates after a given amount of time has passed. I’ve used the tag-based approach for this project. See more in the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data">Next.js documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Since the data coming from Sanity has been tagged after fetching it, revalidateTag() is used to revalidate all entries associated with a given tag. In Sanity settings, I created a webhook that triggers when Sanity Studio content changes, and this triggers a POST request to be sent to an API endpoint in my Next.js app. A secret URI is shared between Vercel, where the site is hosted, and Sanity.</p>

<p>This ultimately causes the revalidateTag() function provided by Next.js to run, and any data on the server that was previously tagged with the same tag sent in the POST request from Sanity will be revalidated.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="routing">Routing</h4>

<p>I used the (home) and (studio) route groups to organise and separate the pages for the studio and the main website. This allowed me to add a root layout for the main website, as well as a root layout for the studio. This was useful because the main website needed a header and additional styling that I didn’t want in the studio.</p>

<p>The about page and contact page are defined like so: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/(home)/about/page.tsx</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/(home)/contact/page.tsx</code>.</p>

<p>For the home page, all art is retrieved and displayed in the gallery.</p>

<p>The category pages are generated with dynamic routing: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/(home)/[category]/page.tsx</code>, where each category of art is retrieved using a getCategories GROQ query. The categories are also passed to the navigation component. This way, if my client decides they want to add a new category, they can, and the website will automatically update to include the new category as a route linked in the navigation.</p>

<p>The art for a given category is then retrieved as described above in the GROQ example code.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In late 2023/early 2024 I built a portfolio website for an artist.

<p>The short version is that I had used the map() Javascript method to map images*, which would be arranged into two columns. I set “column-count: 2” on the parent container of the images. This is an easy way to create the masonry effect that is common on websites like Pinterest, with the downside being that someone tabbing through the images with a keyboard will have to look through them top to bottom, left to right, instead of left to right, top to bottom.</p>

<p>This looked fine on my computer, until I started testing the website on other devices. I noticed that on an iPad mini with an older version of Chrome (117.0.5938.117), the top of the second column was not aligned with the top of the first column. It had shifted down by about 10 pixels. At first I thought it must be because of the older Chrome version and I added the -webkit- prefix to my CSS, assuming that would fix the problem. But after making that adjustment and redeploying the website, the problem persisted, and on checking, I found that <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=column-count">column-count should be supported for Chrome 117</a>. Checking the website on Safari on the same device, the same problem was there.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to have to redeploy my website every time I was testing a potential solution. So I discovered that I could run a local development server on my PC and access it from another device. I was using Gatsby, and all I had to do was specify the host to be my IP address when I ran gatsby develop; for example: “gatsby develop –host=192.168.1.2”. Then I could open the development website on the iPad I was seeing the issue on and start troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Although this was helpful for testing on the specific device I had at hand, the iPad mini, I wanted to see what other devices had the same problem. I found <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack</a> and, unfortunately, due to their limited free trial, only had 1 minute to test the site on various devices and would also need to set up a way to view the development site. This was starting to feel unneccessarily complicated, so I ultimately created <a href="https://emoore29.github.io/column-count-tester/">this webpage</a> to let me quickly view the page on various devices/browsers and see if the columns looked different. I’ve explained what I found there.</p>

<p>In summary, this was a useful lesson in being precise with my CSS styles, a valuable refresher on the behaviour CSS of “display” property types, and a reminder that just because it looks right on my screen, it might not look right on another.</p>

<p>*Importantly, img elements have a display of inline-block by default. So I really shouldn’t have stumbled on this problem at all. I had been using Gatsby Images, and I had applied “display: flex” to my images because I had been having trouble getting them to display the same way an img element would. After a certain point I had forgotten I ever did that, and despite it being unnecessary, it stayed in my CSS until I came back to it to uncover this “bug”.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came across unexpected behaviour of columns I had created using the column-count CSS property.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First Note</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/notes/2023/04/24/first-note.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Note" /><published>2023-04-24T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-04-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/notes/2023/04/24/first-note</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/notes/2023/04/24/first-note.html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of my studies and projects, I’ve come across some personal portfolios that inspired this notes section (<a href="https://heather-buchel.com/">here</a> <a href="https://brianlovin.com/writing">are</a> <a href="https://rmurphey.com/">a</a> <a href="https://octavian.work/">few</a>).</p>
