    <main class="page-content"><p>Hi! I’m Emma, and I live in Perth, Western Australia. I started coding in 2022 as a hobby. I did some free courses with freeCodeCamp and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.</p>

<p>I started building various websites with React-based frameworks (you can view some of these projects at <a href="http://localhost:4000">my work</a>, and/or <a href="https://github.com/emoore29">my GitHub profile</a>) and self-studying things like logic gates and computer networking.</p>

<p>Although I’ve worked in the editing field for the past several years, since starting my hobby, I’m much more drawn to building things and solving problems with code.</p>

<p>I wanted to expand my experience and improve my foundational understanding of computer science, so I decided to pursue a more formal education. I’m currently completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Technology, estimated to finish by September 2025.</p>
