These are my summary notes based on reading the book [_But How Do It Know?_ by J. Clark Scott](https://www.amazon.com.au/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC), and I have linked any other resources I used to supplement my understanding.

#### Logic Gates

Logic gates are small electrical circuits wired in such a way as to process binary inputs into a binary output. To do this, they use transistors, which are basically electronic switches that can be turned on or off.

Here is an example circuit for a NAND gate:

It's not necessary to understand the electronics to understand how a gate like this can be used to build a computer. Therefore, the above is often simplified into the following diagram:

There are many other types of logic gates. In _But How Do It Know?_, the author shows how to create these other gates from a NAND gate.
