title: "Why programming?"

Growing up, some of my favourite games were [Myst and Riven](https://cyan.com/games/). Something about being stuck on a puzzle for hours and scrutinising every little detail in the games really appealed to me. I think that should have been a hint that I would enjoy the detailed problem solving and logic involved in programming, but that didn't click for me until much later in my life.

People are often told to follow their "passion" when it comes to choosing a career path. When I graduated high school and entered university, I followed this advice. First, I pursued veterinary science, because I loved animals. When that didn't feel right, I enrolled in my BA in Professional Writing and Publishing, because I loved reading.

I am lucky to have had both learning experiences. Memorising anatomy, physiological pathways, and medicines, taught me that I wanted to do something that involved more creativity and logic. My BA gave me the freedom to explore philosophy courses and mathematics in addition to professional writing. This felt closer to what I enjoy doing, and I am grateful to have then found a position as a transcriptionist.

After several years working in court transcription, research editing, and completing a report-writing internship with the Red Cross, I started to reflect more intentionally about my career. I realised that passion alone wasn't enough to sustain a career, and that I needed to find a role that played more to my strengths and the skills I enjoy exercising.

While transcription used one of my biggest strengths - attention to detail - I wanted the chance to exercise the critical thinking and analytical skills I developed in my BA in a new, creative, and challenging way.

My brother, a firmware engineer, had over the years suggested that I try programming. Growing up, it was never even on my radar as a potential career. Maybe I can blame some gendered assumptions I had ingrained in me as a child or the lack of computer science classes in my education, but for whatever reason, I never made a conscious decision to pursue programming, despite excelling at mathematics and physics in high school.

Anyway, one day I decided I was just going to try it, with no grand plans to make a career out of it, just to see if I enjoyed it. I worked through some free courses on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and really enjoyed them. I built some websites for friends and family, and from there I realised if I wanted to take this new hobby more seriously, I should get a more formal education to open up more opportunities to work in the field and fill in the gaps in my self-taught knowledge.

Now I spend most of my free time working on my own projects while completing my Graduate Diploma in IT, and my only regret is that I didn't start sooner in life.
